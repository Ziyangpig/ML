# iterative algorithm
## elements
* initial point(fine for convex problem)
* search direction
* step size/ learning rate
* stopping criterion

# Gradient-based Optimization Algorithm

> most learning problems do not have closed form solution, but they are convex problems, which provide great property when using gradient-based methods
>
> namely, the point where $\{nbala}=0$ is the global optimal point
